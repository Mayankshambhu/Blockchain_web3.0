# Blockchain and Web 3.0: Decentralizing the Future

## Overview

This project presents a detailed exploration of two emerging technologies: **Blockchain** and **Web 3.0**. The PowerPoint slides and accompanying video provide a clear explanation of how these technologies work, their key features, benefits, and potential challenges. This repository includes both the presentation content and the code used to generate it programmatically.


## Features
- **Introduction to Blockchain**: Learn how blockchain enables decentralization and provides secure, tamper-proof transactions.
- **Web 3.0 Overview**: Understand how the internet is evolving into a decentralized, user-centric model.
- **DeFi and NFTs**: Explore how decentralized finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are disrupting industries like finance and art.
- **Smart Contracts**: Learn about the power of self-executing smart contracts on the blockchain.
- **Challenges & Risks**: Understand the key challenges that blockchain and Web 3.0 face, including scalability and regulation.
